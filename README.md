# Reparameterized control & Koopman MPC for BCG treatment

Reparameterized Multiobjective Control implemented in Python with PSO method for optimization "Reparameterized Multiobjective Control of BCG Immunotherapy" by Yue, R. and Dutta, A. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47406-z).


Koopman Model Predictive Control with impulsive input implemented by Matlab code based on code from https://github.com/MilanKorda/KoopmanMPC/ by Milan Korda and Igor Mezic with the paper "Linear predictors for nonlinear dynamical systems: Koopman operator meets model predictive control" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03537.pdf).
